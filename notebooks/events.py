def cusumFilterEvents(close, threshold):
    '''
    Symmetric CUSUM Filter.
    It is a quality-control method, designed to detect a shift in
    the mean value of the measured quantity away from a target value.
    The value of each filter is:
      S^{+}_t = max{0, S^{+}_{t-1} + y_t - E_{t-1}[y_t]}, S^{+}_0 = 0
      S^{-}_t = mix{0, S^{-}_{t-1} + y_t - E_{t-1}[y_t]}, S^{-}_0 = 0
      S_t = max{S^{+}_t, -S^{-}_t}

    See Advances in Financial Analytics, snippet 2.4, page 39.


    @param close A price series.
    @param threshold A positive threshold to flag a positive or negative
           event when either S^{+}_t or S^{-}_t is greater than it.
    @return A subset of the @p close index series where the events of
            filter are triggered.
